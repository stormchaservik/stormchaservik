## Hello there o/

I do a bit of everything, but I'm mostly into scientific computing and numerical analysis. My interests are HPC, GPUs, graphics, compilers and embedded systems.

This GitHub account is mainly for projects that I work on in my free-time. You can contact me on Telegram or by email. I'm always looking to collaborate.
